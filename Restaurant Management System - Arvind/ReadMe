Hello there!

I am Arvind of CSE branch, VJIT.
So, I've been a part of the RubiconRed's journey for a short time by submitting my project as a task provided.

The Java application which I have developed of my knowledge would have the features like,
-Menu
-valet parking
-Takeaway
-Reservation's
-Check (Bill)
-Busboy
-Chef
-Review's

Each class does it's implementation by the help of the MAIN class providing calls to the other classes.

Thank you!
